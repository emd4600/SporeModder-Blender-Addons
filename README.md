## Features:
These addons allow you to export models to Spore using the 3D modelling software [**Blender 2.8**](https://www.blender.org/). The addons include:

 - **RW4 Exporter**: Used to export models into Spore to use them for your mods, with support for textures, materials, animations...
 - **RW4 Importer**: Used to import most models in the game into Blender, so you can see how they are made.
 - **GMDL Importer**: Used to import Spore creations into Blender (`.gmdl` files).
